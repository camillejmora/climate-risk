Literature on direct and indirect climate risks. IF: interesting finding.

IF: If hazards are considered as compound events, where we decompose it into its contributing variables, it can help guide more robust climate model development.

IF: A major ongoing challenge is that conventional climate risk assessments can't handle the complexity of interacting factors.

IF: Climate change governance must consider borderless climate change risks, since the risk of climate change is not confined to one country. Advancing to the dominant territorial framing is vital.
